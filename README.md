## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, we utilized three microphones arranged in a triangular configuration to track the angle of a sound source in a 2D plane. The microphones were interfaced with an ARM M4F core (TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller) via an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). By detecting time differences in the arrival of sound signals at each microphone, the microcontroller calculates the precise angle of the sound source.

The device is equipped with a command-line interface, allowing users to interact with the system, configure settings, and retrieve angle data in real-time. The interface supports various commands to adjust thresholds, display ambient noise levels, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time AoA Calculation**: Uses three microphones to determine the angle of a sound source.
- **Interactive Shell Interface**: Customize settings and view real-time data through a command-line interface.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Implemented on a resource-constrained microcontroller, proving that complex problems can be solved with minimal hardware.
